## TODO

# tracking algorithm and data analysis 
1. start with very low thresholds to include as many data points as possible (no trheshold to die out), systems where rain rate gets less and then more need to be connected 
2. visualization of tracked features, comparison of reanalysis and observation and look what data points I can actually capture with my algorithm (invert colorscale!)
3. derive features: average speed, direction (vector diagrams for movement description), weight lon and lat mean by intensity, environmental impact/intensity duration, max rain rate/ duration, max rain rate/ speed
4. maybe save as python daya types instead of netcdf?





What questions do I want to answer:
- find systems which produce a lot of precipitation at one location
- what fraction of precipitation are covered by the "systems"? 
- how and why do the climatologies of systems differ between satellite and reanalysis ? 
- what are the connections to other parameters and large-scale circulation? (check whether reanalysis parameters can not be used together with satellite data, when satellite and reanalysis can track the same large systems with heavy rainfall)
- if the datasets not match: what happens on the ground? explore the bias... 



What can I already now see in the data:
- much more "systems" south of TP (needs to be visualized and showed clearly!)
- diurnal pulse 





# more advanced features to include in algorithm:
- linked lists
- deal with merging and splitting
